### Hi, I'm Karina ðŸ‘‹


My quant training began in Neuroscience academia (BS Harvard, PhD Columbia), where I've focused on the neural circuitry of learning. But over time I've become increasingly interested in applying the tools of experimentation, data science and artificial intelligence to societal challenges. Some favorite projects have been:

- Digital Identity Managament: As Civic Technologies' first data scientist, I served as the bridge between tech and business, extracting data driven insights to support our mission of giving individuals back control of their digital identities.

- EdTech: As the cofounder of The Owlry, I helped craft a digital platform that taught students how to curate their own personalized STEM learning journeys.

- Urban Housing: As a data consultant for Parity, I work on AI approaches to maximize the speed with which derilect properties can be restored to the Baltimore community for affordable home ownership.

ðŸ“š On my learning shelf:  Deeper dives into computer vision and LLMs  
ðŸ”§ In the works:  A machine vision tool to generate construction plans for returning derilect properties to baseline structural integrity  
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:  What we know about learning and how it compares across neuroscience, education and AI
ðŸ’¡ Keen to discuss:  How AI, experimentation and data-driven approaches can shape a better tomorrow!
