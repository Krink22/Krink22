### Hi, I'm Karina ðŸ‘‹


Trained as a neuroscientist (BS Harvard, PhD Columbia), I've found experimentation, programming, data analysis and machine learning to be powerful tools for untangling the neural circuitry of learning. But over time, I've become increasingly interested in applying these tools to improve broad societal systems. Some favorite projects have been:
  
- &nbsp;&nbsp;Digital Identity Managament: As Civic Technologies' first data scientist, I served as the bridge between tech and business on our mission to give individuals control of their digital identities.

- &nbsp;&nbsp;EdTech: As the cofounder of nonprofit The Owlry, I helped craft a digital platform that taught students struggling during the pandemic how to curate their own personalized STEM learning journeys.

- &nbsp;&nbsp;Urban Housing: As a data consultant for the nonprofit Parity, I work on AI approaches to maximize the speed with which derilect properties can be restored to the Baltimore community for affordable home ownership.

ðŸ“š&nbsp;&nbsp;**On My Learning Shelf&nbsp;&nbsp;:**&nbsp;&nbsp;Diving deeper into computer vision and LLMs.  
ðŸ”§&nbsp;&nbsp;**In The Works&nbsp;&nbsp;:**&nbsp;&nbsp;Building a machine vision tool to scope construction needs for derelict property restoration.  
ðŸ’¬&nbsp;&nbsp;**Ask Me About&nbsp;&nbsp;:**&nbsp;&nbsp;How learning compares across neuroscience, education and AI.  
ðŸ’¡&nbsp;&nbsp;**Keen To Discuss&nbsp;&nbsp;:**&nbsp;&nbsp;How AI, experimentation and data-driven approaches can shape a better tomorrow!
