### Hi, I'm Karina ðŸ‘‹


My quant and programming background began in Neuroscience academia. I trained at Harvard (BS) and Columbia (PhD) before joining a lab at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute studying the neural circuitry of learning.

Over time I've become increasingly interested in the world of data science and artificial intelligence and applying it to human system challenges.

- In Digital Identity Managament: As Civic Technologies' first data scientist, I served as the bridge between tech and business, helping extract narrative insights from raw data.
- In EdTech: As the cofounder of The Owlry, I helped craft a digital platform for students to curate personalized STEM learning journeys.
- In Urban Housing: As a data consultant for Parity, I'm working on AI approaches to maximize the speed with which derilect properties can be assessed for rehabilitation and returned to the Baltimore community for affordable home ownership.

ðŸ”§ In the works: a machine vision tool to generate a building plan for bringing derilect properties back to baseline structural integrity
ðŸ“š On my learning shelf: Deeper dives into computer vision and LLMs
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: the intersection of learning in neuroscience, education and AI
ðŸ’¡ Keen to discuss: How AI, experimentation and data-driven approaches can shape a better tomorrow!
